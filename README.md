2. [Login](https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create) to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to import the stack
    > `Home > Developer Services > Resource Manager > Stacks > Create Stack`
3. Upload the `jenkins-stack-configuration.zip` file that was downloaded earlier, and provide a name and description for the stack
4. Configure the stack
   1. **Jenkins username** - Provide a username for jenkins login
   2. **Jenkins password** - Provide a password for jenkins login
5. Review the information and click Create button.
   > The upload can take a few seconds, after which you will be taken to the newly created stack
6. On Stack details page, click on `Terraform Actions > Apply`

The private ssh key for the Linux VM will be displayed along with the public ip of the server on the Application Information tab.
